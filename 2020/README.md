# Advent of Code 2020

### Advent of Code 2020 in Python 🐍🎄🎁🎅⭐️

Should be less time-consuming than one language a day 🤔

Gonna try to go to the end, this time! 💪🤓

### Completion : 50/50 ⭐️

Did it!  
I'm really happy to have completed it on time this year, and pretty proud of my solutions for most of the puzzles. Learning Python specific features through the days was quite cool too.

Maybe I'm gonna try to complete my unachieved 2019 next. In all cases, see you next December, Advent of Code! 👋
