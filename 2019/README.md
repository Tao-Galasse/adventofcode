# Advent of Code 2019

### Advent of Code 2019 with different languages 😄🎄🎁🎅⭐️

Initially planned to solve each day with a different language, but some of them required to use previous solution (the Intcode computer), resulting in multiple days solved with Python (by chance 🤷‍♂️). 

Moreover, learning new languages everyday seemed to be possible in the beginning, but was finally too time-consuming because of work & studies stuff in the same period.

I eventually stopped after several days, but I'm still proud of this first time trying this challenge and the few knowledges I gained on the languages I tried 😄

### Completion : 18/50 ⭐️
